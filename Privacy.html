Usage Data: We collect anonymous information about how you interact with the app (e.g., which rooms are scanned most often) to improve our AI models.

Device Information: We may collect data such as your device model, operating system version, and unique device identifiers to ensure app stability.

2. App Permissions and Usage
To provide a full range of features, Fixit requests access to certain device functions. Below is how and why we use these permissions:

Camera (NSCameraUsageDescription): Fixit uses your camera to capture photos of home repairs, damage, or issues. For example, you can take a photo of a water leak or cracked tile, and Fixit will analyze the image to provide diagnostic information, repair guidance, and cost estimates.

No Sale of Data: We do not sell your photos or personal data to third parties.

5. Third-Party Service Providers
We may use third-party companies (such as OpenAI, Google Cloud, or AWS) to facilitate our AI analysis. These providers have access to your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
